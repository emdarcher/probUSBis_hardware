probUSBis Hardware
==================

Hardware files for probUSBis board.

This board is heavily inspired and based off of the [LittleWire](http://littlewire.cc/) and 
[DigiSpark](http://digistump.com/products/1) projects, with some little features of my own added to it.

The files are being made in KiCAD, but PDFs of the schematics will be made for releases.
